Challenge Instructions

```
Automation Challenge
- Build a small testing framework for web pages
- Add the following tests for

DuckDuckGo — Privacy, simplified.
- Search for Michael Jordan and verify:
- A picture of Michael Jordan is displayed in the search results page
- There is at least one wikipedia page results
- There is at least one nba.com page result
- Go to the 'Theme' page of duckduckgo, change the theme to 'Terminal'. Save and go to the main page. Verify the background color has changed.
- Go to the 'All settings' page of duckduckgo, change the language to 'Lingvo' and verify the 'Language' label has been changed by 'Lingvo'
Build a small script that retrieves data from duckduckgo's api (DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API):
search for 'dogs' and print a list of all images retrieved
search for 'dogecoin' and print a list of all urls
Notes:
You can use JavaScript and any libraries/framework to build the tests. 
We would like to see Gherkin implemented if possible, using any library like 'behave'.
It would be nice if the web pages tests generate any sort of basic html report.
